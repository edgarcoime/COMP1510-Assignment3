    Computational thinking:
    Decomposed this problem into a single action; randomly choose an integer from 0 to max, then, store the value
    in a variable. This pattern is repeated a set number of times depending on how many rolls the user specifies.
    This process can be automated by using a while loop to repeat choosing a random integer a set number of times.
    The result is then returned back to the user as a integer.
